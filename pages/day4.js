    title: "Day 4 ‚Äî The Unexplained Disappearance of Funds",
    story: `The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) initiates a top-secret investigation into a senior officer of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) after an anonymous tip-off. The tip alleges that the officer, a highly respected Deputy Director with an impeccable service record, has amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. The CBI is brought in, and its investigators are tasked with unraveling a complex web of financial transactions, shell companies, and benami properties registered in the names of the officer's relatives and close associates. The investigation team works for months, meticulously tracing every suspicious transaction.
Course of Action Taken/Investigation: The CBI conducts a discreet but exhaustive investigation. They find numerous deposits in various bank accounts and property purchases made in the names of the officer's relatives and close associates, for which no legitimate source of income can be established. When confronted with this evidence, the officer provides vague and contradictory explanations, claiming the funds were from gifts and a small family business. However, he fails to provide any credible evidence, such as financial records, tax returns, or gift deeds, to support his claims. A departmental inquiry is launched, and a formal charge sheet is issued alleging a violation of Rule 3(1) of the CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964, regarding integrity and devotion to duty.
Proves that Came Out:
- A comprehensive CBI investigation report detailing the disproportionate assets.
- The officer's failure to satisfactorily explain the source of the funds and provide supporting documents during the inquiry.
- The legal principle that in cases of disproportionate assets, the burden of proof shifts to the government servant to explain their source.`,
    question: `The officer's lawyer argues that the department has not proven his guilt "beyond reasonable doubt," a standard required in criminal cases. Therefore, he claims, no penalty can be imposed. Explain in a paragraph why the lawyer's argument is flawed and what standard of proof is used in departmental inquiries.`,
